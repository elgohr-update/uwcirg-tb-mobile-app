## Getting Started

To run this application on your local computer,
make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

Run `./bin/setup`,
and be ready to provide credentials for the `dhair2` repo on Gitlab.

You may be prompted for an administrator password,
depending on how Docker is set up on your computer.

If all goes well, your application will start up after a few minutes.
If not, please [open an issue] here on GitHub.
