##  Mobile Application Intervention for Tuberculosis Patients
Tuberculosis remains one of the top ten causes of death globally despite it being largely curable. Patients face many challenges to adhere to treatment and mobile health (mHealth) interventions may address these challenges and support patients to complete their treatment. We aim to develop an application that has implications not only for TB adherence but disease management more generally and to improve our understanding of how to support patients throughout challenging treatment regimens.

## History of Project 
A previous version of this applicaiton was developed on this repo and the code is still available on the [v1-stable]([https://github.com/uwcirg/tb-mobile-app/tree/v1-stable](https://github.com/uwcirg/tb-mobile-app/tree/v1-stable)) branch.

Version 2 aims to provide a feedback driven UI, more scalable architecture, and better user engagement. Furthermore, we aim to provide a good experience for users on inconsistent connections, using ideas from [progressive web apps]([https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)).
